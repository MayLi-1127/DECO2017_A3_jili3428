>With the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more schools are supporting online instruction.

The biggest beneficiaries of online courses are international students. Through remote teaching, they can still complete their studies as scheduled without going abroad.

However, online teaching also brings some disadvantages. For example, students cannot communicate with teachers in time, and they cannot study independently and attentively in an environment far away from the classroom and campus. These problems will bring more pressure to study, therefore, it is urgent to create an online learning platform.

>Through online ethnography, questionnaires, and interviews, I analyzed the needs of international students. They need a platform that can better manage courses/tasks, plan time more reasonably, and help them complete tasks more quickly and efficiently. They need a platform that can help them focus on their studies.

Therefore, my StudBud platform includes two major functions: task management and time management. In addition, a dictionary function is added to help international students understand professional vocabulary faster and learn more efficiently.


## About Change
In A2, I made a mock-up, but it's still flawed in some ways. Through teacher comments and peer feedback, I have revised and refined some features. Below I will describe these changes and the reasons for the changes.

#### Changes to the Left Bar
Although I separate the home page and the Task Management function page in A2, there is no real-time feedback in the left bar, which means that when the user clicks on other pages and jumps, they will not be able to return to the main page, so in A3, I added the Home icon to jump to the Home page.

#### Layout changes
In A2, each page consists of three parts: The welcome part, the music player, and the functional area. In the new version of the design, except for the home page, the Welcome part of each page has been changed to Page Title, so that through the title, users can clearly know the main functions of each page. The paginated layout divided by function can reflect each function more clearly.

#### Changes to Home Page
In the part of the Weekly Schedule, I removed the Schedule list. On the one hand, the content in Todo is repeated with Schedule. On the other hand, the lengthy list and a lot of Task content will make users have negative emotions, which is not conducive to relieving stress and learning with ease.

#### Changes to the Music Player
Changed functionality, from a single track loop to a switchable music player, giving users more possibilities.

#### Changes to Task Management
In the new version, I distinguish tasks with different color blocks. The color represents the priority of the task, users can view the corresponding task by selecting a certain color. Human energy and time are limited, prioritization can help users allocate time and energy reasonably.

#### Change of Timer
Avoid the countdown factor that makes users panic. Change to a reminder clock that can be manually turned on (default 25 minutes), and distinguish it from the task duration timer on the right to ensure the two functions can be run separately or together. At the same time, it is convenient for users to choose a time management method that is more suitable for them.

#### Changes to Dictionary
Remove the original alphabet and change it to a search bar, which is convenient for users to quickly locate words. When querying words, the page no longer jumps, and the word definition is directly displayed at the bottom of the page for quick viewing. Keep history function to help users quickly see what they have learned/read.

## About Change
This time I learned a new layout structure - Bootstrap. Self-adaptation has always been a problem for me, and Bootstrap can effectively solve these problems. It achieves self-adaptation by splitting regions. Although I am not very proficient, can solve the problem of partial self-adaptation, which is an improvement for me.

Also, I learned a lot about how to write js files through some online tutorials. Being able to play music, etc. through JavaScript was a breakthrough for me. Although there are still some functions that cannot be implemented due to technical bottlenecks, I have made great progress in the writing of web pages. At least I no longer worry about page layout structure and simple adaptive. I am very happy to have such a try and gain through this assignment.
